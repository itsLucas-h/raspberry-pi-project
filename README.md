# Raspberry Pi Project

This repository contains the group project for the ENSE810 Embedded Software Engineering course, focused on developing software for an embedded system using the Raspberry Pi platform. The project involves hands-on learning through a series of labs and tutorials covering Python programming, hardware integration, version control, UML modelling, multithreading, and database management. Working in a team of three, we apply these techniques to design and implement a functional embedded system, demonstrating a systematic development process from initial setup to final presentation.
